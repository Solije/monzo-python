Monzo Python
============

Monzo Python allows you to quickly and simply access, manipulate and
play with our banking data. Let's get started.

Make sure you have `Python` and `pip` on your machine (this package was built and tested with Python 3.5, but it should work
with 2.7, too. Your mileage may vary with other versions)

To install the package run ::

    pip install monzo

If the above doesn't work, you may want to run the above command as an admin by prefixing `sudo`.

Once you're done, open up a Python terminal (or create a Python file) and enter the following::

    from monzo.monzo import Monzo # Import Monzo Class

    client = Monzo('access_token_goes_here') # Replace access token with a valid token found at: https://developers.getmondo.co.uk/
    account_id = client.get_first_account()['id'] # Get the ID of the first account linked to the access token
    balance = client.get_balance(account_id) # Get your balance object
    print(balance['balance']) # 100000000000
    print(balance['currency']) # GBP
    print(balance['spend_today']) # 2000

Yup. That easy. To see what more you can do with the `client` variable, take a look at the `Monzo Module` section
of the API docs linked below.
